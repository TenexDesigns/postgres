In PostgreSQL, an enumeration data type is a user-defined data type that represents a set of discrete values as a list of labels.
An enumeration data type is created using the CREATE TYPE command with the ENUM option, followed by a list of label values enclosed in parentheses.

Heres an example of how to create an enumeration data type in PostgreSQL:



CREATE TYPE shirt_size AS ENUM ('small', 'medium', 'large');



In this example, weve created an enumeration data type called shirt_size that contains three possible values: small, medium, and large.

Once an enumeration data type is defined, it can be used to define columns in tables, just like any other data type.
Heres an example of how to create a table that includes a column with an enumeration data type:


CREATE TABLE shirts (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    color varchar(50),
    size shirt_size
);






In this example, we have created a table called shirts with three columns: id, color, and size.
The size column is defined using the shirt_size enumeration data type we defined earlier.

To insert values into a table with an enumeration data type, you can use the label values defined in the enumeration. For example:

  
  INSERT INTO shirts (color, size) VALUES ('red', 'medium');


In this example, weve inserted a row into the shirts table with a color of red and a size of medium, 
which are both valid label values for the shirt_size enumeration data type.
