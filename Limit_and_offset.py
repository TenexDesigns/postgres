In PostgreSQL, the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used together with the SELECT statement to control the amount of data returned by a query.


LIMIT:
  
The LIMIT clause is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query.
It is followed by an integer that specifies the maximum number of rows to be returned.
For example, to retrieve the first 10 rows from a table named "users", you would use the following command:

SELECT * FROM users
LIMIT 10;

This will return the first 10 rows from the "users" table.


OFFSET:
  
  
The OFFSET clause is used to skip a specified number of rows from the beginning of the query result.
It is also followed by an integer that specifies the number of rows to skip. 
For example, to retrieve rows 11-20 from the "users" table, you would use the following command:

SELECT * FROM users
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;


This will skip the first 10 rows and return the next 10 rows from the "users" table.


Using LIMIT and OFFSET together:


You can also use the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses together to return a specific subset of rows from a query result. 
For example, to retrieve rows 21-30 from the "users" table, you would use the following command:


SELECT * FROM users
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;


This will skip the first 20 rows and return the next 10 rows from the "users" table.

In summary, the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are useful for controlling the amount of data returned by a query, especially when dealing with large tables. 
By using these clauses, you can improve the performance of your queries and make them more efficient.
