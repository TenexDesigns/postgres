In PostgreSQL, logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause or in other expressions.
Here are the three logical operators that can be used in PostgreSQL:

1.AND: The AND operator returns true if both conditions separated by AND are true. For example:
This query will return all the customers whose age is between 18 and 25, inclusive.

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age >= 18 AND age <= 25;




2.OR: The OR operator returns true if at least one of the conditions separated by OR is true. For example:
This query will return all the customers whose age is less than 18 or greater than 25.



SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age < 18 OR age > 25;



3.NOT: The NOT operator reverses the logical value of the following condition. For example:
This query will return all the customers whose age is not greater than 25.
    
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE NOT age > 25;


These logical operators can be combined to form complex conditions.
Parentheses can be used to group conditions and specify the order of evaluation. For example:


SELECT * FROM customers WHERE (age >= 18 AND age <= 25) OR (gender = 'female' AND state = 'California');


This query will return all the customers whose age is between 18 and 25 or who are female and live in California.
