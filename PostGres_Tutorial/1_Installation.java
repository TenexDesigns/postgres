Sure, let's briefly cover the installation and setup of PostgreSQL and the creation of databases and schemas.

**1. Installation and Setup:**

**Installing PostgreSQL on Various Platforms:**
PostgreSQL can be installed on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Here are the general steps:

**a. Windows:**
   - Download the PostgreSQL installer for Windows from the official website.
   - Run the installer and follow the installation wizard.
   - During the installation, you can choose the installation directory, data directory, and configure the PostgreSQL superuser password.

**b. macOS:**
   - You can install PostgreSQL on macOS using tools like Homebrew or by downloading the PostgreSQL for macOS package from the official website.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided by your chosen method.

**c. Linux:**
   - On most Linux distributions, you can install PostgreSQL using the package manager (e.g., `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu or `yum` for CentOS/Red Hat).
   - After installation, PostgreSQL should start automatically. You can use `systemctl` or `service` to manage the PostgreSQL service.

**Setting up User Roles and Access Control:**
   - After installation, PostgreSQL creates a default superuser called "postgres."
   - You can use the superuser to create additional roles (users) and manage their access privileges.
   - Access control is managed through the `pg_hba.conf` file, where you define which hosts can connect to the PostgreSQL server and how they can authenticate.

**2. Database Creation:**

**Creating Databases and Schemas:**
   - Once PostgreSQL is installed and running, you can create databases and schemas.
   - To create a database, you can use the `createdb` command or execute SQL commands. For example:

   ```sql
   createdb mydatabase
   ```

   - To create a schema within a database, you can use the `CREATE SCHEMA` SQL command. Schemas are useful for organizing and structuring your tables and objects within a database.

   ```sql
   CREATE SCHEMA myschema;
   ```

   - To connect to a specific database or schema, you can use the `psql` command-line tool or connect via a PostgreSQL client.

These steps provide a basic overview of the installation, setup, and database creation process in PostgreSQL. Additional configurations and customizations may be required based on your specific needs and platform.
