Certainly, let's go over SQL basics in PostgreSQL with code samples:

**3. SQL Basics:**

**Data Types in PostgreSQL:**
PostgreSQL offers a wide range of data types, including numeric, character, date/time, and more. Here are some examples:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE
);
```

**Creating Tables and Defining Primary Keys:**
You can create tables and define primary keys to ensure each row's uniqueness:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price NUMERIC(10, 2)
);
```

**Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Data:**
To insert data:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, hire_date)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', '2023-01-15');
```

To update data:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET first_name = 'Jane'
WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

To delete data:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

**Retrieving Data Using SELECT Statements:**
To retrieve data:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees;
```

**Filtering Data Using WHERE Clauses:**
You can filter data using the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > 50;
```

**Sorting Data with ORDER BY:**
Sort data using `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;
```

**Aggregation and Grouping with GROUP BY and Aggregate Functions:**
Group data and use aggregate functions:

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

**Joining Tables to Retrieve Data from Multiple Tables:**
Combine data from multiple tables using joins:

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

**4. Advanced SQL:**

**Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries:**
Subqueries allow you to nest one query within another:

```sql
SELECT product_name
FROM products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);
```

**Window Functions for Advanced Data Analysis:**
Window functions operate on a set of rows related to the current row:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, hire_date, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) as row_num
FROM employees;
```

**Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**
CTEs provide temporary result sets within a query:

```sql
WITH top_employees AS (
    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > 75000
)
SELECT * FROM top_employees;
```

**Indexing and Optimizing Queries:**
To optimize queries, create indexes on columns:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_product_name ON products (product_name);
```

These SQL basics and advanced SQL concepts should give you a good start in working with PostgreSQL.
