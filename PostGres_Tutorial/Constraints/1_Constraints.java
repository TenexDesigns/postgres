Certainly! Here are code samples and explanations for defining constraints, creating relationships between tables, and database design in PostgreSQL:

**Constraints:**

**1. UNIQUE Constraint:**
   - The UNIQUE constraint ensures that the values in a column (or a combination of columns) are unique across all rows in the table.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
       employee_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
       employee_email VARCHAR UNIQUE,
       employee_name VARCHAR
   );
   ```

   In this example, the `employee_email` column must contain unique values for each row.

**2. NOT NULL Constraint:**
   - The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE products (
       product_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
       product_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
       price DECIMAL
   );
   ```

   The `product_name` column is required and cannot contain NULL values.

**3. CHECK Constraint:**
   - The CHECK constraint allows you to define custom rules for column values.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE orders (
       order_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
       order_date DATE,
       order_total DECIMAL CHECK (order_total >= 0)
   );
   ```

   The CHECK constraint ensures that `order_total` is not negative.

**4. Foreign Key Constraint (Referential Integrity):**
   - Foreign keys establish relationships between tables, enforcing referential integrity.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE authors (
       author_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
       author_name VARCHAR
   );

   CREATE TABLE books (
       book_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
       book_title VARCHAR,
       author_id INT REFERENCES authors(author_id)
   );
   ```

   In this example, the `author_id` column in the "books" table references the `author_id` column in the "authors" table. This enforces referential integrity.
