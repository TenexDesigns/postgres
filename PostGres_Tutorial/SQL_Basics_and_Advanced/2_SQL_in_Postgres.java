**SQL Basics**

**Data types in PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL supports a wide variety of data types, including:

* Integers: `INT`, `BIGINT`, `SMALLINT`
* Strings: `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`, `TEXT`
* Dates and times: `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`
* Booleans: `BOOLEAN`
* Floating-point numbers: `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`
* Arrays: `INT[]`, `VARCHAR[]`, `DATE[]`
* JSON: `JSON`

**Creating tables and defining primary keys**

To create a new table in PostgreSQL, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` statement. For example, to create a new table called `users` with two columns, `id` and `name`, you would run the following command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);
```

The `SERIAL` data type is a special type of integer that is automatically incremented each time a new row is inserted into the table. The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint specifies that the `id` column is the primary key of the table. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in the table.

**Inserting, updating, and deleting data**

To insert a new row into a table, you can use the `INSERT` statement. For example, to insert a new user into the `users` table with the name `John Doe`, you would run the following command:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('John Doe');
```

To update a row in a table, you can use the `UPDATE` statement. For example, to update the name of the user with the ID of `1` to `Jane Doe`, you would run the following command:

```sql
UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;
```

To delete a row from a table, you can use the `DELETE` statement. For example, to delete the user with the ID of `1`, you would run the following command:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

**Retrieving data using SELECT statements**

To retrieve data from a table, you can use the `SELECT` statement. For example, to select all of the rows from the `users` table, you would run the following command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

To select specific columns from a table, you can list the column names in the `SELECT` clause. For example, to select the `name` column from the `users` table, you would run the following command:

```sql
SELECT name FROM users;
```

You can also use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results of a `SELECT` statement. For example, to select all of the users from the `users` table with the name `John Doe`, you would run the following command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

**Filtering data using WHERE clauses**

The `WHERE` clause allows you to filter the results of a `SELECT` statement. The `WHERE` clause can contain any valid SQL expression. For example, the following `SELECT` statement selects all of the users from the `users` table who are older than 18:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;
```

You can also use the `AND` and `OR` operators to combine multiple conditions in the `WHERE` clause. For example, the following `SELECT` statement selects all of the users from the `users` table who are older than 18 and live in the United States:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18 AND country = 'US';
```

**Sorting data with ORDER BY**

The `ORDER BY` clause allows you to sort the results of a `SELECT` statement. The `ORDER BY` clause can contain any column name in the table. You can also specify the sort order (ascending or descending) using the `ASC` and `DESC` keywords. For example, the following `SELECT` statement selects all of the users from the `users` table and orders them by name in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC;
```

**Aggregation and grouping with GROUP BY and aggregate functions**

The `GROUP BY` clause allows you to group the results of a `SELECT` statement. The `GROUP BY` clause can contain any column name in the table. You can also use the `HAVING` clause to filter the grouped results.
