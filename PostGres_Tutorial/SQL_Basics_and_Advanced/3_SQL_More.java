**Joining tables to retrieve data from multiple tables**

When you need to retrieve data from multiple tables, you can use a join. A join allows you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a common field. There are four main types of joins:

* **Inner join:** An inner join returns all rows from both tables where the common field matches in both tables.
* **Left join:** A left join returns all rows from the left table, even if there is no matching row in the right table.
* **Right join:** A right join returns all rows from the right table, even if there is no matching row in the left table.
* **Full join:** A full join returns all rows from both tables, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the other table.

To perform a join, you use the `JOIN` clause in your `SELECT` statement. The `JOIN` clause specifies the two tables that you want to join and the common field that you want to join them on. For example, the following `SELECT` statement performs an inner join between the `users` table and the `orders` table on the `user_id` column:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

This statement will return all rows from both tables where the `user_id` column matches in both tables.

**Subqueries and correlated subqueries**

A subquery is a query that is nested within another query. Subqueries can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as filtering data, aggregating data, and joining tables.

A correlated subquery is a subquery that references a column from the outer query. Correlated subqueries can be used to perform complex operations that cannot be performed with a single query.

For example, the following `SELECT` statement uses a correlated subquery to select all users who have placed an order in the last 30 days:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE users.id IN (
  SELECT order_id
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 30 DAY
);
```

This statement will return all rows from the `users` table where the `user_id` column matches an `order_id` in the `orders` table where the `order_date` is greater than 30 days ago.

**Window functions for advanced data analysis**

Window functions are a powerful tool for advanced data analysis. Window functions allow you to perform calculations on a set of rows, such as the ranking of rows, the moving average of rows, and the cumulative sum of rows.

For example, the following `SELECT` statement uses the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to rank all users by the number of orders they have placed:

```sql
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY 1 ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
FROM users;
```

This statement will return all rows from the `users` table, plus a new column called `rank` which contains the rank of each user by the number of orders they have placed.

**Common table expressions (CTEs)**

Common table expressions (CTEs) are a way to define temporary named subqueries. CTEs can be used to simplify complex queries and make them more readable and maintainable.

For example, the following `SELECT` statement uses a CTE to select all users who have placed an order in the last 30 days:

```sql
WITH recent_orders AS (
  SELECT order_id
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 30 DAY
)
SELECT *
FROM users
JOIN recent_orders ON users.id = recent_orders.order_id;
```

This statement is equivalent to the previous example that used a correlated subquery, but it is more readable and maintainable.

**Conclusion**

These are just a few of the many advanced SQL features that can be used to perform complex data analysis and retrieval. For more information, please refer to the PostgreSQL documentation.
