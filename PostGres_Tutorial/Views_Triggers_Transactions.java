Certainly, let's explore each of these topics with code samples:

**1. Views:**
A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query. Views can simplify complex queries and provide a logical layer over the underlying tables.

Creating a View:
```sql
-- Creating a view to retrieve information about students
CREATE VIEW student_view AS
SELECT id, name, age
FROM students
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Querying the view
SELECT * FROM student_view;
```

**2. Materialized Views:**
A materialized view is a physical copy of the query result that is updated periodically. It can significantly improve query performance by storing precomputed results.

Creating a Materialized View:
```sql
-- Creating a materialized view to store the average age of students
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW avg_student_age AS
SELECT AVG(age) as avg_age
FROM students
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Refresh the materialized view when needed
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW avg_student_age;

-- Querying the materialized view
SELECT * FROM avg_student_age;
```

**3. Triggers:**
Triggers are database functions that are automatically invoked when a specific event occurs in the database.

Creating a Trigger:
```sql
-- Creating a trigger to update a timestamp when a student record is modified
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_timestamp()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Attaching the trigger to the students table
CREATE TRIGGER update_student_timestamp
BEFORE UPDATE ON students
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_timestamp();
```

**4. Functions and Procedures:**
User-defined functions and procedures can be written in PL/pgSQL or other supported languages.

Creating a Function:
```sql
-- Creating a PL/pgSQL function to calculate the square of a number
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION square(num numeric)
RETURNS numeric AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN num * num;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Using the function
SELECT square(5); -- Returns 25
```

**5. Transactions:**
PostgreSQL supports transactions to ensure the integrity of data and consistency of the database.

Using Transactions:
```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO students (name, age, status) VALUES ('Alice', 22, 'active');

-- Update data
UPDATE students SET age = 23 WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- Commit the transaction to save changes
COMMIT;

-- Rollback the transaction to undo changes
ROLLBACK;
```

**6. Savepoints:**
Savepoints allow you to set points within a transaction to which you can later roll back.

Using Savepoints:
```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO students (name, age, status) VALUES ('Bob', 25, 'active');

-- Set a savepoint
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

-- Update data
UPDATE students SET age = 26 WHERE name = 'Bob';

-- Roll back to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;

-- Commit the transaction to save changes
COMMIT;
```

These code samples illustrate how to work with views, materialized views, triggers, functions, procedures, transactions, and savepoints in PostgreSQL. You can adapt and extend these examples to meet your specific database needs.
