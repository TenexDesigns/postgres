In PostgreSQL, a subquery is a query that is nested inside another query.
The subquery is executed first and its result is used as input for the outer query. 
Subqueries can be used in many ways, such as in WHERE clauses, SELECT statements, and other parts of a SQL query.

Here are some examples of subqueries in PostgreSQL:


  
  1.Subquery in a WHERE clause


Lets say we have two tables "employees" and "departments", and we want to find all employees who work in the "Sales" department.
We can use a subquery in the WHERE clause to select the department_id of the "Sales" department from the "departments" table:

  
  SELECT id, name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Sales');





2.Subquery in a SELECT statement

Using the same tables "employees" and "departments", we can use a subquery in the SELECT statement
to find the name of the department that each employee works in:

SELECT id, name, (SELECT name FROM departments WHERE id = employees.department_id) AS department_name
FROM employees;





3.Subquery in a FROM clause (derived table)

Lets say we want to find the total salary paid to employees in each department.
We can use a subquery in the FROM clause to create a derived table that calculates the total salary for each department:

SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM (SELECT department_id, salary FROM employees) AS derived_table
GROUP BY department_id;



These are just a few examples of how subqueries can be used in PostgreSQL.
Subqueries are a powerful tool for performing complex SQL queries, and they can be used in many different ways to manipulate and analyze data.
