In PostgreSQL, you can enforce uniqueness and non-null constraints on one or more columns in a table using the following syntax:

To add a unique constraint on a column:


ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name UNIQUE (column_name);

For example, if you have a table named "employees" and you want to ensure that the "email" column contains unique values, you can use the following command:


ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT email_unique UNIQUE (email);


To add a not null constraint on a column:


ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET NOT NULL;


For example, if you have a table named "employees" and you want to ensure that the "name" column cannot contain null values, you can use the following command:

ALTER TABLE employees ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL;


Note that these commands will fail if the table already contains data that violates the constraint.
In that case, you will need to remove or modify the offending rows before adding the constraint.
