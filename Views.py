In PostgreSQL, a view is a virtual table that is created from a SELECT statement.
Views allow you to reuse complex queries, hide the complexity of underlying tables,
and present data in a more meaningful way. Views can be used in the same way as a table, 
i.e., you can query a view with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.

Heres an example of how to create a view in PostgreSQL:

Syntax:

  
  CREATE [TEMP | TEMPORARY] VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;




Code Sample:

Let's assume we have a table called "employees" with columns "id", "name", 
"department", and "salary". We can create a view called 
"employee_details" that shows only the "id", "name", and "salary" columns of the "employees" table:



CREATE VIEW employee_details AS
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM employees;


After creating the view, we can use it in the same way as a table:


SELECT * FROM employee_details;




We can also use the view in other queries, such as:

  SELECT name, salary
FROM employee_details
WHERE salary > 50000;




Views can also be used to simplify complex queries. For example, lets say we want to find the average salary of employees in each department.
We can create a view called "department_avg_salary" that calculates the average salary for each department:



CREATE VIEW department_avg_salary AS
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;


Then we can use the view to query the average salary of each department:



SELECT department, avg_salary
FROM department_avg_salary
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;





In this example, we used the view to hide the complexity of the query and present the data in a more meaningful way.
