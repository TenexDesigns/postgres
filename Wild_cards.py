In PostgreSQL, wildcards are special characters that can be used in conjunction with the LIKE operator in a WHERE clause to search for patterns in text data. 
Here are the two wildcard characters that can be used in PostgreSQL:


  %: The percent sign (%) represents any string of zero or more characters. For example:
  This query will return all the customers whose name starts with the letter "J".
      SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'J%';

  This query will return all customers who have  a "J" anywhwere in their name.    

      SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE '%J%';
      
      
  _: The underscore (_) represents any single character. For example:
This query will return all the customers whose name starts with any two characters followed by the letter "a".
    
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE '__a%';




You can also use the NOT LIKE operator to exclude certain patterns from your search. For example:


SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name NOT LIKE 'J%';



This query will return all the customers whose name does not start with the letter "J".

In addition to these wildcard characters, PostgreSQL also supports other pattern matching operators,
such as ~ (regular expression match) and !~ (regular expression not match), which can be used for more complex pattern matching requirements.
