In PostgreSQL, you can add comments to your SQL code using two types of comment syntax:
  
  
  
  Single-line comments: These comments begin with two dashes (--) and continue to the end of the line. For example:
      
      SELECT * FROM users; -- This is a single-line comment
  

  
  Multi-line comments: These comments begin with /* and end with */. For example:
      
      /* This is a multi-line comment
   that can span multiple lines */

  
  
  EXPRESSIONS
  *******************************************************************************************************************************

  Expressions are used to perform calculations or evaluate values in PostgreSQL.
  They can be used in various parts of a query, such as the SELECT statement, WHERE clause, and ORDER BY clause.
  Some examples of expressions in PostgreSQL include:


Arithmetic expressions: These expressions use mathematical operators (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations on numeric values. For example:

SELECT 2 + 3 * 4; -- Output: 14


String expressions: These expressions manipulate text values using functions like CONCAT or SUBSTRING. For example:

SELECT CONCAT('Hello', ' World'); -- Output: Hello World



Comparison expressions: These expressions compare two values using operators like =, <, >, <=, >=, and <>. For example:

    
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18; -- Returns all users over 18 years old


Overall, comments and expressions are useful tools for writing clear and efficient SQL code in PostgreSQL.
