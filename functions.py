In PostgreSQL, there are two main types of functions: scalar functions and aggregate functions.

Scalar functions are functions that take one or more input values and return a single output value. 
They are typically used to manipulate or transform data within a single row of a table.
Some common examples of scalar functions in PostgreSQL include:


String functions: Functions like SUBSTRING, LOWER, and UPPER that manipulate string values.

Numeric functions: Functions like ABS, ROUND, and CEIL that perform mathematical operations on numeric values.

Date and time functions: Functions like NOW, DATE_TRUNC, and DATE_PART that manipulate date and time values.



Aggregate functions, on the other hand, are functions that operate on a set of rows and return a single output value.
They are typically used to summarize or aggregate data across multiple rows of a table. 
Some common examples of aggregate functions in PostgreSQL include:


Count: Counts the number of rows in a group.

Sum: Calculates the sum of a set of numeric values.

Average: Calculates the average of a set of numeric values.



  
  Here is an example of an aggregate function that calculates the average salary of all employees in a table:


SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;



Overall, scalar functions and aggregate functions are both important tools for working with data in PostgreSQL.
By using these functions, you can manipulate and summarize data in powerful and flexible ways.
